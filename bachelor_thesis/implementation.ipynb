       "      <td>Introduction\\n\\nThis book is open access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license.\\n\\nThis volume discusses the prospects and evolution of informatics (or computer science), which has become the operating system of our world, and is today seen as the science of the information society. Its artifacts change the world and its methods have an impact on how we think about and perceive the world. Classical computer science is built on the notion of an “abstract” machine, which can be instantiated by software to any concrete problem-solving machine, changing its behavior in response to external and internal states, allowing for self-reflective and “intelligent” behavior. However, current phenomena such as the Web, cyber physical systems or the Internet of Things show us that we might already have gone beyond this idea, exemplifying a metamorphosis from a stand-alone calculator to the global operating system of our society.\\n\\nThus computer scientists will need to reconsider the foundations of their discipline to realize the full potential of our field. Taking often contradictory developments into consideration, researchers will not be able to tackle specific technological or methodological problems in the future without also a broader reflection on their field. The papers in this book take a first step forward and reflect on these issues from different perspectives. The broad spectrum of topics includes\\n\\nInformatics: a discipline with a (short) history and a high impact\\nInterdisciplinarity: how to do research\\nEthics: what is our responsibility\\nDiversity: why are there so few women in informatics\\nCombining informatics, history and art: a special contribution.\\nThis book is intended for all informatics researchers, in academia as well as in industry. It is our responsibility – not only as scientists but also as citizens – to make the public aware of the dichotomies and dialectic relationships of computer science.</td>\n",

       "4  Introduction\\n\\nThis book is open access under a CC BY-NC 4.0 license.\\n\\nThis volume discusses the prospects and evolution of informatics (or computer science), which has become the operating system of our world, and is today seen as the science of the information society. Its artifacts change the world and its methods have an impact on how we think about and perceive the world. Classical computer science is built on the notion of an “abstract” machine, which can be instantiated by software to any concrete problem-solving machine, changing its behavior in response to external and internal states, allowing for self-reflective and “intelligent” behavior. However, current phenomena such as the Web, cyber physical systems or the Internet of Things show us that we might already have gone beyond this idea, exemplifying a metamorphosis from a stand-alone calculator to the global operating system of our society.\\n\\nThus computer scientists will need to reconsider the foundations of their discipline to realize the full potential of our field. Taking often contradictory developments into consideration, researchers will not be able to tackle specific technological or methodological problems in the future without also a broader reflection on their field. The papers in this book take a first step forward and reflect on these issues from different perspectives. The broad spectrum of topics includes\\n\\nInformatics: a discipline with a (short) history and a high impact\\nInterdisciplinarity: how to do research\\nEthics: what is our responsibility\\nDiversity: why are there so few women in informatics\\nCombining informatics, history and art: a special contribution.\\nThis book is intended for all informatics researchers, in academia as well as in industry. It is our responsibility – not only as scientists but also as citizens – to make the public aware of the dichotomies and dialectic relationships of computer science.   \n",

       "      <td>Táto knižka je výsledkom doktorandského seminára, ktorý som viedol v akademickom roku 2014/2015. Na Fakulte informatiky a informačných technológií máme šikovných študentov \\nschopných naplniť aj náročné predstavy. Jednou takou predstavou je, aby zo seminára vznikol \\nmonotematický výskumný text, ktorý dopracujeme do podoby, pripravenej na tlač. V oblasti \\nprogramových a informačných systémov sa takéto štúdie podarilo vydať už niekoľkokrát. Zatiaľ \\nčo v prvom zväzku Štúdií sme podchytili seminár venovaný návrhovým vzorom a v druhom se\u0002minár venovaný webovej inteligencii, v treťom sa seminár sústreďoval na podstatu softvérovej \\narchitektúry a v štvrtom zväzku sme spracovali témy seminára, venovaného softvérovým paradigmám. Zatiaľ posledný, piaty zväzok sa venuje webovede, vznikajúcej vedeckej disciplíne, \\nktorá chce študovať web v rôznych aspektoch.\\nTento v poradí už šiesty zväzok sa zameriava na odporúčanie v softvérovom inžinierstve. \\nMetódy odporúčania informácií sa intenzívne študovali v predošlých zhruba dvadsiatich rokoch \\nnajmä v súvislosti s odporúčaním informácií na webe. V posledných rokoch dochádza k čoraz \\nintenzívnejšiemu uvedomeniu, že tieto alebo podobné metódy môžu byť užitočné aj \\nv softvérovom inžinierstve.

       "      <td>Cieľom tejto učebnice je poskytnúť študentom informatiky na Fakulte informatiky a informačných technológií STU ucelený text k prednáške „Algebra \\na diskrétna matematika“. Diskrétna matematika patrí medzi teoretické základy \\ninformatiky. Slúži nielen pre rozvoj matematicko-logických schopností študentov, ale aj ako teoretická príprava pre ďalšie „pokročilejšie“ informatické predmety. Pri koncipovaní obsahu tejto prednášky stáli sme pred neľahkou úlohou, čo \\nzahrnúť do jej obsahu a čo nie. Pretože táto prednáška substituuje čiastočne aj \\nbývalý predmet „Lineárna algebra“, zahrnuli sme z tejto oblasti do učebnice \\nv rozsahu dvoch prednášok aj základy lineárnej algebry, teórie matíc a sústav \\nlineárnych rovníc spolu s elementárnou teóriou determinantov. \\nUčebnica je určená pre študentov prvého ročníka bakalárskeho štúdia, ktorí majú \\nzákladné stredoškolské vedomosti z teórie množín, algebry a výrokovej logiky. \\nV prednáške sme sa snažili čo najviac vyjsť v ústrety potrebám informatiky, preto \\naj oproti časti týkajúcej sa algebry je relatívne uprednostnená diskrétna matematika. Cieľom učebnice je aj rozvinúť u študentov schopnosť rigorózneho matematického myslenia pri riešení a formulovaní problémov informatiky. \\nPrvá kapitola sa týka metód matematického dôkazu. Kapitoly 2 až 5 sú venované \\nteórii množín a kombinatorike, v 6. a 7. kapitole sa venujeme grupám a boolovskej algebre. Kapitoly 8 až 9 sú venované maticiam, sústavám lineárnych rovníc \\na determinantom. Zvyšok učebnice sa v 10. až 13. kapitole venuje teórii grafov \\na základným algoritmom a aplikáciám teórie grafov. \\nKaždá kapitola je sprevádzaná príkladmi, ktorých riešenie poskytne študentom \\nschopnosť dobre sa orientovať v danej problematike. Chceme poďakovať mnohým našim študentom, ktorí nám pomohli nájsť veľa nepríjemných preklepov, \\nnepresností a evidentných chýb, a tým prispeli k zvýšeniu kvality tejto učebnice. \\nTaktiež sa musíme poďakovať nášmu zosnulému kolegovi prof. Ing. Norbertovi \\nFrištackému, PhD., s ktorým sme sa často radili pri koncipovaní sylabu prednášky. Na jeho radu sme zaradili do prednášky Quinovu a McCluskeyho metódu \\noptimalizácie Boolovej funkcie špecifikujúcej logický obvod. Až pri prednášaní \\ntohto predmetu sme zistili, že táto „aplikačná“ časť diskrétnej matematiky patrí \\nmedzi študentmi k najobľúbenejšej časti predmetu.</td>\n",

Na Fakulte informatiky a informačných technológií máme šikovných študentov \\nschopných naplniť aj náročné predstavy. Jednou takou predstavou je, aby zo seminára vznikol \\nmonotematický výskumný text, ktorý dopracujeme do podoby, pripravenej na tlač. V oblasti \\nprogramových a informačných systémov sa takéto štúdie podarilo vydať už niekoľkokrát. Zatiaľ \\nčo v prvom zväzku Štúdií sme podchytili seminár venovaný návrhovým vzorom a v druhom se\u0002minár venovaný webovej inteligencii, v treťom sa seminár sústreďoval na podstatu softvérovej \\narchitektúry a v štvrtom zväzku sme spracovali témy seminára, venovaného softvérovým paradigmám. Zatiaľ posledný, piaty zväzok sa venuje webovede, vznikajúcej vedeckej disciplíne, \\nktorá chce študovať web v rôznych aspektoch.\\nTento v poradí už šiesty zväzok sa zameriava na odporúčanie v softvérovom inžinierstve. \\nMetódy odporúčania informácií sa intenzívne študovali v predošlých zhruba dvadsiatich rokoch \\nnajmä v súvislosti s odporúčaním informácií na webe. V posledných rokoch dochádza k čoraz \\nintenzívnejšiemu uvedomeniu, že tieto alebo podobné metódy môžu byť užitočné aj \\nv softvérovom inžinierstve. Ide najmä o odporúčania, ktoré sa poskytnú softvérovému inžinierovi. Ukázalo sa, že je až prekvapujúco veľa možností, čo by bolo vhodné odporúčať niekomu, kto \\nsa podieľa na vývoji softvéru. Druhou stránkou je pestrosť metód, ako odporúčania robiť. \\nCelú problematiku som rozdelil do trinástich častí medzi študentov seminára. Východiskovým literárnym zdrojom pre štúdium bol monografický zborník [1]. Po prednesení príspevkov \\na diskusii na seminári spracovali autori témy aj písomne.

       "2  Cieľom tejto učebnice je poskytnúť študentom informatiky na Fakulte informatiky a informačných technológií STU ucelený text k prednáške „Algebra \\na diskrétna matematika“. Diskrétna matematika patrí medzi teoretické základy \\ninformatiky. Slúži nielen pre rozvoj matematicko-logických schopností študentov, ale aj ako teoretická príprava pre ďalšie „pokročilejšie“ informatické predmety. Pri koncipovaní obsahu tejto prednášky stáli sme pred neľahkou úlohou, čo \\nzahrnúť do jej obsahu a čo nie. Pretože táto prednáška substituuje čiastočne aj \\nbývalý predmet „Lineárna algebra“, zahrnuli sme z tejto oblasti do učebnice \\nv rozsahu dvoch prednášok aj základy lineárnej algebry, teórie matíc a sústav \\nlineárnych rovníc spolu s elementárnou teóriou determinantov. \\nUčebnica je určená pre študentov prvého ročníka bakalárskeho štúdia, ktorí majú \\nzákladné stredoškolské vedomosti z teórie množín, algebry a výrokovej logiky. \\nV prednáške sme sa snažili čo najviac vyjsť v ústrety potrebám informatiky, preto \\naj oproti časti týkajúcej sa algebry je relatívne uprednostnená diskrétna matematika. Cieľom učebnice je aj rozvinúť u študentov schopnosť rigorózneho matematického myslenia pri riešení a formulovaní problémov informatiky. \\nPrvá kapitola sa týka metód matematického dôkazu. Kapitoly 2 až 5 sú venované \\nteórii množín a kombinatorike, v 6. a 7. kapitole sa venujeme grupám a boolovskej algebre. Kapitoly 8 až 9 sú venované maticiam, sústavám lineárnych rovníc \\na determinantom. Zvyšok učebnice sa v 10. až 13. kapitole venuje teórii grafov \\na základným algoritmom a aplikáciám teórie grafov. \\nKaždá kapitola je sprevádzaná príkladmi, ktorých riešenie poskytne študentom \\nschopnosť dobre sa orientovať v danej problematike. Chceme poďakovať mnohým našim študentom, ktorí nám pomohli nájsť veľa nepríjemných preklepov, \\nnepresností a evidentných chýb, a tým prispeli k zvýšeniu kvality tejto učebnice. \\nTaktiež sa musíme poďakovať nášmu zosnulému kolegovi prof. Ing. Norbertovi \\nFrištackému, PhD., s ktorým sme sa často radili pri koncipovaní sylabu prednášky. Na jeho radu sme zaradili do prednášky Quinovu a McCluskeyho metódu \\noptimalizácie Boolovej funkcie špecifikujúcej logický obvod. Až pri prednášaní \\ntohto predmetu sme zistili, že táto „aplikačná“ časť diskrétnej matematiky patrí \\nmedzi študentmi k najobľúbenejšej časti predmetu.   \n",

However, media resistance is not just about disappointment, but also about hope. In the ﬁctional as well as non-ﬁctional works discussed in this book, there is not so much hope that media or society will really change, but some hope that each and every one of us can improve our lives by freeing ourselves from media entrapment. By replacing media use with non-media activities, it is suggested that one can build a future that is happier, more genuine and authentic, and based on more real-life encounters and pursuits. A third and ﬁnal explanation as to how media resistance is sustained is that it does not to any great degree depend on speciﬁc, detailed or even empirical evidence, and also remains at a signiﬁcant distance from most academic media studies. In early protests against the mass media, there were strong expectations that expert evidence would come out in favour of resistance, that uncertainty and apprehension would give way to a solid scientiﬁc foundation. Although momentous amounts of research about harmful consequences of media have been initiated, evidence remains ambiguous and often do not ﬁt the concerns of resisters; those critical and sceptical of the way media transformed society did not get precise answers from science. Some material discussed here draws – selectively – on evidence from media effects research, some point to so-called medium theorists to argue that media’s harm go beyond content and involve technology and functions, but, in general, the references to ﬁndings and perspectives from (empirical) media studies are scarce in the texts and arguments discussed in this book. To the degree that books and articles touch on media studies and media experts, sceptics often express disappointment in what they see as the discipline’s pro-media stance, and disappointment with the way media scholars have contributed to legitimize controversial media, genres and technologies. Although media criticism may well be taught in a media studies class, many media sceptics – and especially those who expressed resistance to television – have expressly distanced themselves from the efforts by media educators and scholars to teach media literacy. As one website cited in Chapter 4 points out, “If the ‘off’ button is the answer, then no media studies course will ever help students ﬁnd it” (White dot 2000b). To the degree that media literacy is explicitly discussed, the sentiment expressed is that this does not point people towards nonmedia activities, but rather increase media fascination and use.... | Similarity: 0.217\n",
      "Book 271, Paragraph 41 | Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization | Reflecting this specificity of different phenomena of media-related changes and their particularities, it is nevertheless striking that they are all confronted with certain trends that characterize the change of the present media environment. If we understand the ‘media environment’ as the entire body of available media at any given time in society (Livingstone 2001: 307; Hasebrink and Hölig 2014: 16; Jensen and Helles 2015: 292), we can initially distinguish at least five such trends: first, a differentiation of a vast number of technologically based media of communication; second, an increasing connectivity of and through these media, which offers the possibility to individually and collectively ‘link’ across space and time; third, a rising omnipresence of media that creates the possibility to connect permanently and everywhere; fourth, a rapid pace of innovation, the emergence of ‘new’ media and services in ever-shorter periods of time; and fifth, a datafication, which is the representation of social life in computerized data via media devices and their underlying software and infrastructure. None of these trends is to be seen as a separate individual media phenomenon; rather, they are all closely linked with each other, and altogether they are characteristic of the present changes in our media environment (Bjur et al. 2014: 15). We have to be aware that these trends are not ‘linear’. It is also uncertain whether these trends will continue or whether other trends will emerge. In addition, they are highly contradictory in themselves. However, altogether they are manifestations of deep mediatization, and distinguishing between such trends provides us with a first understanding of the media-related changes in which we are involved. The trend for differentiation in the media means that the number of media and their functionalities have increased over recent decades. While in the beginning there was a discussion concerning whether digitalization might result in the dominance of the computer as the sole ‘metamedium’ (Kay and Goldberg 1977; Höflich 2003),4 it turned out that the result of digitalization was rather the arrival of a variety of very different media, which at the present stage are becoming more and more digital and increasingly based on software (see Manovich 2013). The differentiation of media gives rise to a variety of contradictory impacts. While digital media might support self-paced learning for young people and adults (Wolf 2015; Wolf and Wudarski in this volume), the same media can be used to build up authoritarian relationships in religious organizations (Radde-Antweiler 2015; Radde-Antweiler and Grünenthal... | Similarity: 0.211\n",
      "Book 271, Paragraph 0 | Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization | We live in times that are characterized by a multiplicity of media: Traditional media like television, radio and newspapers remain important, but have all undergone fundamental change in the wake of digitalization. New media have been emerging with an increasing speed: Internet platforms, mobile media and the many different software-based communication media we are recently confronted with as ‘apps’. This process is experiencing yet another boost from the ongoing and increasingly fast sequence of technological media innovations. In our modern social world, communication processes take place across a variety of media. As a consequence, we can no longer explain the influences of media by focusing on any one single medium, its content and possible effects. In order to explain how media changes are related to transformations in culture and society we have to take into account the cross-media character of communications. In view of this, the book series ‘Transforming Communications’ is dedicated to cross-media communication research. It aims to support all kinds of research that are interested in processes of communication taking place across different kinds of media and that subsequently make media’s transformative potential accessible. With this profile, the series addresses a wide range of different areas of study: media production, representation and appropriation as well as media technologies and their use, all from a current as well as a a historical perspective. The series ‘Transforming Communications’ lends itself to different kinds of publication within a wide range of theoretical and methodological backgrounds. The idea is to stimulate academic engagement in crossmedia issues by supporting the publication of rigorous scholarly work, text books, and thematically-focused volumes, whether theoretically or empirically oriented.

The focus of European respondents was much more on institutional partnerships, as we shall see below. Social media Social media, such as Twitter, YouTube, blogs, LinkedIn, academia. edu and Facebook, are increasingly used by individual academics. For instance, one of our African respondents maintained a blog linked to a number of social media: (Af1) I am engaged in community work dealing with the digital preservation of Arabic manuscripts, musical performances and the film industry. I have a website and a production company (visually ethnographic, part of the website). I use these platforms to interact with the community of writers, local scholars, practitioners to find ways of improving practices at all levels. A similar use of social media was reported by one of our Indian respondents (As5). Research centres are also increasingly using social media, as reported by an American interviewee (NA1), whose centre, in addition to live streaming public lectures, uses social media to create attention. Another American (NA6) had started a research project to showcase humanities research, building on digital resources. The use of social media for academic purposes is seen as both critical and contentious in Russia where the use of Facebook has become an important tool, not least for academics living in provincial Russia. Often, the success of academics seems measured by the number of public interviews and their visibility in social media. This was confirmed at our Russian workshop as well as in individual interviews. While one respondent (R6) maintained his own blog, he warned against the dangers of overgeneralisation/oversimplification when using fast electronic media. In general, however, he believed that most academics have little time for social media. This sentiment was shared by another Russian (R8) who felt that ‘research suffers from overtranslation and media misuse as salon science’. Although the use of social media for academic work is under-researched, it is conceivable that it provides a fast and much more personal way to engage with user communities and build support for particular research. But it also carries opportunity costs in terms of sacrificing research time. Conventional publicity should still remain pivotal in academia.... | Similarity: 0.193\n",

      "Book 72, Paragraph 132 | New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research | To conclude, three epistemological issues raised by the development of the CRISES Database on Social Innovations should be mentioned. These relate to the nature, validity and interpretation of data. The case studies included in the database so far are mainly based on qualitative research methods that take into account the (inter)subjective interpretation of the phenomena under study (Anadón and Guillemette, 2007). This is reflected in the dominance of interviews as a way of learning about the point of view of key actors. To deal with this issue, the proposed database is designed to allow for a transition to a quantitative analysis of data, namely by reducing and formalising the information. Yet, how can it be ensured that their intended meaning does not get lost in the process? On the other hand, the creation of a database of case studies raises the question of the triple interpretation of data: that of the interviewees who provided the information to the researchers conducting the case studies; that of the researchers who collected, organised, analysed and published the data; and the interpretation of the team of researchers who re-conceptualised and organised the information from the case studies for the creation of the database. Given these multiple interpretations, what reading can be given of the results of the comparative analyses generated by the database? Finally, faced with these multiple levels of interpretation, how can the codification of normative evaluations be prevented, in other words, those comprising value judgments rather than facts? Nonetheless, the case studies all have a common focus: social innovation. Moreover, the three to four data collection templates used in the various research programmes at CRISES through time share many common concepts and dimensions of analysis. The case studies concerned observations that were relatively limited in time (thirty years) and space (Québec). A number of contextual (institutional, demographic, sociopolitical, etc.) variables are, therefore, common to many of them. In short, the many case studies produced by CRISES constitute a source of knowledge and information that has been underutilised to date. Aside from representing a unique opportunity for research of its kind, the project to create a relational database requires formalising a conceptual framework of social innovation to advance the theoretical analysis underlying its work. To create a quantitative approach and a relational database is a novel way to research social innovation. It is a new way of gathering data in order to develop theories about the generation, emergence and life cycle of social innovations. Should other researchers in the world opt for a similar conceptual framework and relational database model,... | Similarity: 0.875\n",
      "Book 72, Paragraph 117 | New Frontiers in Social Innovation Research | Introduction Research on social innovation has, to date, mainly been carried out through case studies. This is due to the unique character of innovations, at least when they emerge, and the fact that the concept of social innovation is still poorly codified. Case studies are typically used to explore new research areas for which existing theory seems inadequate. A case study approach is the prescribed methodology to explore phenomena that are not easily distinguishable from their context and to document them thoroughly by referring to multiple information sources (Yin, 1994). A cross-analysis of many case studies can shed light on the links between different forms of social innovation and their configurations, evolution and distribution in time and space. However, the ultimate value of such an analysis is quickly exhausted due to the limited amount of information that can be processed in a qualitative way. Moreover, cross-analyses are likely to fail to establish links between much of the data from case studies, which impedes knowledge building. These observations prompted a team of researchers from the Centre de Recherche sur les Innovations Sociales (CRISES) to build a data warehouse – the CRISES Database on Social Innovations – dedicated to the analysis of data that has so far been limited to the case method. The working hypothesis is that a quantitative analysis of a large number of cases will reveal aspects of social innovation that have not previously been observed while also generating information on the relationship between social innovation and social transformation. The CRISES Database on Social Innovations initially focuses on an existing body... | Similarity: 0.837\n",
      "Book 271, Paragraph 574 | Communicative Figurations : Transforming Communications in Times of Deep Mediatization | Taking the example of school data systems, we could demonstrate what it means to put digital traces in context: the data collected by the respective systems have to be linked with further, detailed information to make them socially meaningful. Only in this way do such data become a source of describing our present complex social world of datafication. For empirical analysis, this is related to three challenges which we consider as fundamental for any social science analysis of digital traces. The first challenge is to find a way to grasp digital traces with reference to a defined social entity. Very often, digital traces are understood as a phenomenon of a single actor, an individual who left the traces through the use of digital media and services. While this is correct for a basic definition of digital traces as well as for many procedures of data generation (it is the single user of an online system who leaves the footprints that are collected by this system—often because the individual is of interest as a customer), our example demonstrates that we rather have to consider these individuals as social actors whose practices are located and embedded in the figurations of further institutional contexts and groups of people (in the case of our example the organization of the school and the different groups of teachers). Only by reflecting this does the data become meaningful. Therefore, we have to have the whole communicative figurations in mind in which the individual who is the ‘originator’ of the respective traces acts. The challenge here is to find a way to link the data being automatically generated with a social analysis of such a figuration. To achieve this, it seems to be appropriate to start the research with the frame of relevance of this figuration and locate the analysis of the digital traces. By so doing, there is a chance of finding helpful ways of contextualizing. As a second challenge, we are confronted with the triangulation of quantitative ‘digital methods’ (in the case of our example the log-file analysis) with forms of qualitative analysis that offer the context information which is needed. As we have seen, combining automatized collected and processed data, on the one hand, with various forms of qualitative interviews or focus groups, on the other, is a promising method. But this again refers back to the first challenge: only if the actor constellation of the figuration under consideration is known does it become possible to conduct such interviews and focus groups. This offers rich data, which... | Similarity: 0.825\n",

      "Book 32, Paragraph 605 | Proceedings of the International Conference on Social Modeling and Simulation, plus Econophysics Colloquium 2014 | Abstract “The pen is mightier than the sword” said in previous times, the role of dispatching information was given to the people with the special trainee, the people called “Mass-Communication”. However, it has become possible for everyone to dispatch the information on social society with the advent of the Web. Accordingly, Enjyo is often observed on Social Networking Services. Enjyo is a phenomenon that leads the tragedy to individual/company who sends the promotion information via a process of consensus formation as the result of many SNS users. In this research, we analyze the value of reputation on social media in some cases with the purpose of modeling Enjyo. In this study, we tried to numerically analyze and model some cases of Enjyo as well as to classify them by using the data on SNS. For achieving our purpose, we proposed a method of measuring a state of Enjyo and applied the case study method for analysis. With this method, the process of the analysis is likely to be influenced by one’s subjective interpretation or assessment. Therefore, we also tried to facilitate its efficiency and accuracy with random sampling. As a result, several patterns of Enjyo were identified. Moreover, one of the cases of appropriate Enjyo extinction was observed.... | Similarity: 0.805\n",
