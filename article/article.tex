This bachelor thesis focuses on analysing and evaluating recommender systems best suitable for digital library datasets. With the rise of digital content, these systems help users navigate large information spaces by generating personalized recommendations. In the introduction we showed the importance and role of Recommender Systems (RS) in filtering and anticipating user preferences across various domains. We then described the different recommendation techniques in detail, showing how they work and what their difficulties are. The project emphasizes Content-Based Filtering techniques, comparing algorithms like BERT, Word2Vec, LDA, and TF-IDF. Offline experiments tested the systemâ€™s ability to provide Top-N book recommendations from the input data and the algorithms were compared based on evaluation metrics such as Usage Prediction, Coverage, Diversity, and Confidence. This work aims to evaluate different recommendation algorithms designed for digital library datasets.
