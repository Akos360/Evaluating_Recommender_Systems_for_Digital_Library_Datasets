Matrix Factorization Techniques for Recommender Systems
-------------------------------------------------------
Content-based filtering
	- creates a profile for a user or product to characterize its nature
	- profiles allow programs to associate users with matching products
	- require gathering external information
	- attributes or genes, significant qualities
Collaborative filtering
	- past user behaviour - previous transactions
	- without requiring profiles
	- Collaborative filtering analyzes relationships between users 
	and interdependencies among products to identify new user-item associations
	- suffers from cold start problem - inability to address the system’s new products and users
	- neighborhood methods 
	- latent factor models
		- Matrix factorization methods
			- characterizes both items and users by vectors of factors inferred from item rating patterns
			- explicit feedback - input by users, ratings
			- implicit feedback - indirectly reflects opinion by observing user behaviour, search patterns, purchase history ...
			- allows incorporation of additional information
			- singular value decomposition SVD
				- a well-established technique for identifying latent semantic factors in information retrieval

Learning algorithms
	- sotchastic gradient descent
		- the algorithm loops through all ratings in the training set
		- for each given training case, the system predicts r ui and computes the associated prediction error
	- alternating least squares ALS
		- ALS techniques rotate between fixing the q’s (items) and fixing the p’s (users). 
		- When all p’s are fixed, the system recomputes the q’s by solving a least-squares problem, and vice versa.
		- ALS is favorable in at least two cases:
			- when the system can use parallelization - computes each q independently and each p independently
			- systems centered on implicit data

Additional input sources
	- cold start problem
	- implicit feedback
		- incorporate additional sources of information about the users
		- use implicit feedback to gain insights into user preferences
		- learn their tendencies
		- the system profiles users through the items they implicitly preferred
	- attributes - demographics
		- gender, age group, income level ...

Temporal dynamics
	- the system should account for the temporal effects reflecting the dynamic, 
	time-drifting nature of user-item interactions.
	- The matrix factorization - modeling temporal effects, improve accuracy. 
	- Decomposing ratings into distinct terms allows the system 
	to treat different temporal aspects separately. 
		the following terms vary over time: 
			item biases, bi(t); 
			user biases, bu(t); 
			user preferences, p u(t)

	- item’s popularity might change over time
	- affect user preferences and therefore the interaction between users and items.

Inputs with varying confidence levels
	- probably likes the product
	- probably not interested in the product
	- attach confidence scores with the estimated preferences

Model-based approaches to profit-aware recommendation
-------------------------------------------------------
	- the central task of the underlying algorithms is 
		thus to predict the relevance of individual content items for a given user, 
		which is then used to create a relevance-ranked list of recommendations

	- research on recommender systems has focused on developing new machine learning models 
		to improve the accuracy of predicting relevant items

	- on consumer value, will directly or indirectly create value 
		for the provider of the recommendations as well

Families of recommendation algorithms:
	- collaborative filtering   CF
		- past behavior of a community of users
	- content based approaches  CB
		- information retrieval (IR)
	- hybrid systems

CF systems:
	- Nearest tneighbors techniques
	- Matrix factorization approaches
	- Learning-to-rank techniques - such as Bayesian Personalized Ranking
	- Neural Networks - Neural Collaborative Filtering

An Improved FusionBased Semantic Similarity Measure for Effective
Collaborative Filtering Recommendations
-------------------------------------------------------

Semantics 
	- the study of meaning in language. 
	- It looks at how words, phrases, and sentences convey meaning.
	- about how we understand and interpret the meanings of words and sentences in various contexts.
	- Words and Meaning 
	- Sentences and Meaning
	- Context Matters
	- Literal and Figurative Meaning
	- Synonyms and Antonyms
	- Ambiguity - words or sentences can have more than one meaning

	- Semantic Web - It adds extra information to web pages so that computers can understand the data, not just display it.
				   - metadata ("John Smith" is a "person" and "author.")

Ontology
	- study of existence, being, and reality
	- big map that tries to explain everything that exists. 
	- It looks at what kinds of things are out there and how they relate to each other.
	- Categories of Being
	- Real vs. Abstract
	- Relationships Between Things

	- Ontologies serve as valuable tools for formally modeling the structures of domain systems based on observed relationships



	- Recommender systems employ information filtering techniques, 
		primarily focused on predicting whether a specific user will be interested in a particular item
		or identifying a set of items that align with a user’s preferences

	- Techniques mainly utilize Semantic Web technologies, 
		including ontologies and semantic reasoning, 
		to improve the similarity assessments used in traditional CB and CF approaches.


	(i) Augmenting domain knowledge represented in ontologies with item-based
		CF to enhance similarity estimations 
	(ii) Enhancing the conventional user-based CF approach by
		incorporating semantic information from ontologies
	(iii) Combining user-based and/or item-based CF
		with semantic-enhanced Content-Based filtering
	(iv) integrating semantic user-based and/or itembased CF 
		with semantic-enhanced CB filtering

	- valuable semantic knowledge, decision-making processes can be significantly improved.
		enables us to provide more informed and precise recommendations. 
		empowers decision-makers with richer information, 
		facilitating better informed choices and more accurate recommendations.

Semantic similarity approaches for evaluating ontological concepts 
can be classified into three main categories: 
	- distance-based,
		- assess concept similarity within a specific taxonomy 
		by considering the distance or edge length between them (shortest path)
	
	- information-theoretic (IC),
		- measures conceptual similarity based on shared information between two concepts. 
		The more shared information, the greater the similarity.
		- Least Common Ancestor
	
	- feature-based approaches
		- the representation of concepts to be compared is done through a set of features
		- various information elements such as the concept’s neighborhood 
		(ancestors, descendants, siblings), synonyms, attribut	es, functions, and more

	- Taxonomy is a system for classifying and organizing things into groups 
		based on their similarities and differences. 
		It’s like a big tree diagram where related items are grouped together.

Semantic Collaborative Filtering Recommendation
	- utilizes semantic Web technologies and features, specifically ontologies, 
		as means that can allow RSs to extract useful knowledge about users
		or items, which ultimately leads to producing effective predictions. 

	- implements a semantic procedure for calculating the similarity between users, 
	based on a measure of the semantic similarity between the products they have rated, 
	aiming to enhance flexibility in similarity detection and reduce the sparsity of CF. 

Hybrid knowledge-based recommendation approach, 
	which integrates ontology and sequential learning patterns for recommending learning resources to learners. 
	Ontology encapsulates knowledge about learners and resources, 
	while a sequential pattern mining algorithm is applied to discover the learner’s historical sequential learning patterns. 
	Collaborative filtering is employed to compute similarities of ratings and make predictions for a target learner. 
	The findings of this approach show its effectiveness in addressing the cold-start problem using ontology-based domain knowledge.
	Additionally, it overcomes sparsity by leveraging learners’ sequential patterns, 
	ensuring accurate predictions even with a few ratings.

Incorporating semantic knowledge along with CF in different aspects. 
	- Some research studies combine knowledge of content (items) 
	with the traditional item-based CF approach as in.
	- Other research studies incorporate semantic knowledge of items 
	with the user-based CF approach.
	- Moreover, combining user-based or item-based CF approaches 
	with semantic-enhanced CB filtering was adopted as effective research in recommender systems. 
	- Lastly, other streams of studies focus on combining semantic knowledge along 
	with CF and data mining models.

Fusion-based semantic similarity measure 
and integrating it with the standard item-based CF similarity. 


The Proposed Semantic Similarity Measure
"the more information two concepts share in common, the more similar they are"

	fusion-based semantic similarity measure
		(i) taxonomy-based knowledge, 
				compute the similarity of items based on their hierarchical positions 
				in the considered taxonomy of specific domain ontology
		(ii) content-based knowledge,
				compute the similarity of items based on their common semantic description 
				as defined in the considered domain ontology using OWL datatype properties
		(iii) inference-based (i.e., implicit) knowledge
				compute the similarity of items through reasoning extensively their semantic description
				(object properties) to infer hidden relationships that might be useful for computing similarity
	
	proposed semantic similarity measure consists of:
		(i) hierarchical-based similarity 
		(ii) attribute-based similarity
		(iii) inferred-based similarity

Ontology Model Definition
	a set of representational primitives that are relevant for modeling a domain of knowledge or discourse. 
	These primitives typically consist of a set of concepts or entities within a domain,
	relationships among these concepts, and attributes that distinguish each concep

	OWL - Web Ontology Language
		- concepts are linked: directly through asserted relationships 
								(explicitly defined by ontology developers within a specific domain)
								- taxonomical (hierarchical)
									- establish hierarchical links among all concepts within a particular domain
								- non-taxonomical relations
									- explicitly established using OWL properties for each concept
							   indirectly through implicit relationships 
								(generated through reasoning based on asserted relationships)

Hierarchical-Based Similarity
	- The hierarchical-based Similarity aims to compute the 
	similarity between instances in a domain of ontology 
	with respect to the concepts that they belong to in the hierarchical structure

Attribute-Based Semantic Similarity Metric
	- measures the similarity among ontology instances based on their shared attributes,
	defined using OWL datatype properties. 
	These properties connect individuals to data values like strings, integers, Booleans, times, and dates.

Inferred Attribute-Based Semantic Similarity Metric
	- aims to measure similarity between instances within a specific domain ontology 
	by examining their shared OWL object properties

	- Object properties establish connections between instances of different concepts. 
	These connections create chains of linked instances within a given OWL domain ontology. 
	Starting with a particular instance in a chain, we can infer other instances by 
	following the links along the entire chain.

	- The inferred attribute-based similarity measure depends
	on a semantic reasoning strategy in which it recursively
	traverses each common object property between two compared instances. 
	Such reasoning leads to infer all possible instances
	that might share similar properties; the more inferred instances
	the more similar the compared instances would be.

Fusion-Based Semantic Similarity Measure
	- targets significant sources of semantic knowledge to 
	define the similarity between instances: 
		their structural information, 
		direct content knowledge that is defined using datatype properties,
		implicit knowledge that is inferred using object properties

	- proportional rate of 3 similarity measures: 
		hierarchical-based similarity, 
		attribute-based similarity, 
		inferred attribute-based similarity


-------------------------------------------------------
A recommender system based on collaborative filtering using ontology
and dimensionality reduction techniques
-------------------------------------------------------
	- actively recommend relevant information to users
	without the need for an explicit search query
	(item-based)	(user-based)

	memory-based 	model-based(hierarchical)
	correlation analysis
	vector similarity

	model-based CF algorithms have been an alternative approach 
	to k-NN to solve the scalability problem of memory-based method

	- Model-based algorithms do not suffer from memory-based drawbacks 
	- can create prediction over a shorter period of time compared to memory-based algorithms 
	because model-based algorithms perform off-line computation for training

	- performance improvement: 
		ontology 
		dimensionality reduction

	improve the accuracy 
		- by alleviating the sparsity issue in item-based CF using ontology.
	improve the scalability 
		- dimensionality reduction techniques

	Ontology
		- Modeling the information at the semantic level
		- ontology is originally defined as:
			- explicit specification of a conceptualization
			- formal specification of a shared conceptualization
			- a knowledge domain conceptualization into a computer processable format 
			which models entities, attributes, and axioms
		- vocabulary and relationships between the concepts
		- concept properties, disjointness statements, value restrictions, 
		and specification of logical relationships between the objects.
	
		- fuzzy ontology 
	
	Clustering
		- Clustering method groups similar items or users into separate clusters 
		to identify neighborhood Clustering techniques have been used either 
		directly or as a preprocessing stage in recommender systems  
		- can solve overgeneralization problem
			
		- model based method - better accuracy 
		in relation to the memory-based approaches	
		- k-means clustering - solve missing-value problems
		- clustering improves the scalability issue in CF
		
	Dimensionality reduction
		- 
		
	CF
		- make meaningful associations between people and their product preferences
		- All CF methods require the past ratings of users 
		in order to predict and accordingly recommend items to the target user

-------------------------------------------------------
A Sequential Recommendation Model for Balancing 
Long- and Short-Term Benefits
-------------------------------------------------------

	consideration of both long-term and short-term interests:
	- Long-term interests represent users’ preferences and 
	interests over a longer time span, 
	reflecting their stable preferences and long-term behavioural patterns. 
	- Short-term interests represent users’ immediate preferences and 
	interests over a shorter time span; 
	these interests are typically influenced by the current context 
	and environment and are temporary and variable. 

Recommendation systems typically need to consider both 
the long-term and short-term interests of users to
provide more accurate and personalized recommendations.

there is a need to capture the dynamic nature of user
interests and how they evolve over time.
