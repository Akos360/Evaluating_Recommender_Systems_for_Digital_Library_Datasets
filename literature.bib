   abstract = {Semantic-enhanced recommendation systems are promising approaches to overcome the sparsity and cold-start problems, which are hard to handle using the conventional collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. Further research is needed to effectively integrate ontologies into collaborative filtering recommender systems. This paper proposes an ontology-based semantic similarity measure to evaluate similarities between items and eventually generate accurate recommendations. The proposed semantic similarity measure termed fusion-based semantic similarity takes into account the semantics of ontological instances (i.e. items) inferred from a specific domain ontology, which is determined by analyzing the hierarchical relationships among the instances, as well as the features of the instances and their relationships to other instances. The new measure comprehensively captures the semantic knowledge associated with instances by exploiting all possible shared semantics between instances in a given domain ontology. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new semantic-enhanced hybrid recommendation approach as a result of combining the new semantic similarity measure with the standard item-based CF to enhance the quality of generated recommendations. In order to assess the effectiveness of our semantic-enhanced hybrid collaborative filtering method, a series of experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed approach against well-established benchmark techniques. The reported experimental results consistently emphasize its superiority, demonstrating enhanced predictive abilities and a notable improvement in the quality of recommendations. More specifically, the proposed approach achieved notable 6\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in certain cases, outperforming other benchmark techniques. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of using semantic-based similarity to enhance the performance of recommendation systems. Such enhancements address challenges within collaborative filtering, potentially leading to advancements in recommendation system design and optimization. © The Author(s) 2024.},

   abstract = {Improving the efficiency of methods has been a big challenge in recommender systems. It has been also important to consider the trade-off between the accuracy and the computation time in recommending the items by the recommender systems as they need to produce the recommendations accurately and meanwhile in real-time. In this regard, this research develops a new hybrid recommendation method based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches. Accordingly, in this research we solve two main drawbacks of recommender systems, sparsity and scalability, using dimensionality reduction and ontology techniques. Then, we use ontology to improve the accuracy of recommendations in CF part. In the CF part, we also use a dimensionality reduction technique, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to find the most similar items and users in each cluster of items and users which can significantly improve the scalability of the recommendation method. We evaluate the method on two real-world datasets to show its effectiveness and compare the results with the results of methods in the literature. The results showed that our method is effective in improving the sparsity and scalability problems in CF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Typically, user behaviour occurs continuously, and considering this dynamic sequence correlation can lead to more accurate recommendations. Sequential recommendation systems have, therefore, become an important means of solving the problem of network information overload. However, existing attention mechanisms are still insufficient for modelling users’ dynamic and diverse preferences. This paper presents a recommendation model based on a multiheaded self-attention mechanism and multitemporal embeddings of long- and short-term interests (MSMT-LSI). MSMT-LSI balances users’ long- and short-term benefits through two multihead self-attention networks and finally forms a hybrid representation for recommendation. After finding the most suitable parameter combinations for the MSMT-LSI model through parameter sensitivity analysis and verifying the advantages of the long- and short-term fusion strategy, related experiments on five well-known datasets and their analysis shows that the performance of MSMT-LSI is better than that of the classical model on the same benchmark dataset. © The Author(s) 2024.},
