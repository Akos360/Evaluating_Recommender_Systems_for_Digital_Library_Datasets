	abstract = {Semantic-enhanced recommendation systems are promising approaches to overcome the sparsity and cold-start problems, which are hard to handle using the conventional collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. Further research is needed to effectively integrate ontologies into collaborative filtering recommender systems. This paper proposes an ontology-based semantic similarity measure to evaluate similarities between items and eventually generate accurate recommendations. The proposed semantic similarity measure termed fusion-based semantic similarity takes into account the semantics of ontological instances (i.e. items) inferred from a specific domain ontology, which is determined by analyzing the hierarchical relationships among the instances, as well as the features of the instances and their relationships to other instances. The new measure comprehensively captures the semantic knowledge associated with instances by exploiting all possible shared semantics between instances in a given domain ontology. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new semantic-enhanced hybrid recommendation approach as a result of combining the new semantic similarity measure with the standard item-based CF to enhance the quality of generated recommendations. In order to assess the effectiveness of our semantic-enhanced hybrid collaborative filtering method, a series of experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed approach against well-established benchmark techniques. The reported experimental results consistently emphasize its superiority, demonstrating enhanced predictive abilities and a notable improvement in the quality of recommendations. More specifically, the proposed approach achieved notable 6\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in certain cases, outperforming other benchmark techniques. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of using semantic-based similarity to enhance the performance of recommendation systems. Such enhancements address challenges within collaborative filtering, potentially leading to advancements in recommendation system design and optimization. © The Author(s) 2024.},

It has been also important to consider the trade-off between the accuracy and the computation time in recommending the items by the recommender systems as they need to produce the recommendations accurately and meanwhile in real-time. In this regard, this research develops a new hybrid recommendation method based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches. Accordingly, in this research we solve two main drawbacks of recommender systems, sparsity and scalability, using dimensionality reduction and ontology techniques. Then, we use ontology to improve the accuracy of recommendations in CF part. In the CF part, we also use a dimensionality reduction technique, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to find the most similar items and users in each cluster of items and users which can significantly improve the scalability of the recommendation method. We evaluate the method on two real-world datasets to show its effectiveness and compare the results with the results of methods in the literature. The results showed that our method is effective in improving the sparsity and scalability problems in CF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Typically, user behaviour occurs continuously, and considering this dynamic sequence correlation can lead to more accurate recommendations. Sequential recommendation systems have, therefore, become an important means of solving the problem of network information overload. However, existing attention mechanisms are still insufficient for modelling users’ dynamic and diverse preferences. This paper presents a recommendation model based on a multiheaded self-attention mechanism and multitemporal embeddings of long- and short-term interests (MSMT-LSI). MSMT-LSI balances users’ long- and short-term benefits through two multihead self-attention networks and finally forms a hybrid representation for recommendation. After finding the most suitable parameter combinations for the MSMT-LSI model through parameter sensitivity analysis and verifying the advantages of the long- and short-term fusion strategy, related experiments on five well-known datasets and their analysis shows that the performance of MSMT-LSI is better than that of the classical model on the same benchmark dataset. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Matrix factorization is a long-established method employed for analyzing and extracting valuable insight recommendations from complex networks containing user ratings. The execution time and computational resources demanded by these algorithms pose limitations when confronted with large datasets. Community detection algorithms play a crucial role in identifying groups and communities within intricate networks. To overcome the challenge of extensive computing resources with matrix factorization techniques, we present a novel framework that utilizes the inherent community information of the rating network. Our proposed approach, named Community-Based Matrix Factorization (CBMF), has the following steps: (1) Model the rating network as a complex bipartite network. (2) Divide the network into communities. (3) Extract the rating matrices pertaining only to those communities and apply MF on these matrices in parallel. (4) Merge the predicted rating matrices belonging to communities and evaluate the root mean square error (RMSE). In our experimentation, we use basic MF, SVD++, and FANMF for matrix factorization, and the Louvain algorithm is used for community division. The experimental evaluation on six datasets shows that the proposed CBMF enhances the quality of recommendations in each case. In the MovieLens 100K dataset, RMSE has been reduced to 0.21 from 1.26 using SVD++ by dividing the network into 25 communities. A similar reduction in RMSE is observed for the datasets of FilmTrust, Jester, Wikilens, Good Books, and Cell Phone. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As time passes, the data within information systems may continuously evolve, causing the target concept to drift. To ensure the effectiveness of data-driven decision making, it is crucial to detect drift in a timely manner and gather relevant information. In this paper, we introduce two methods that can directly detect concept drift in the provided information system, by considering a new perspective on uncertainty. First, using entropy under a single attribute constraint, we define the uncertainty of the target concept in an information system. By integrating the uncertainty of each attribute, the overall uncertainty of the target concept in the information system is obtained. Subsequently, two concept drift detection methods are proposed, namely EBTBM (Entropy-Based Threshold-Based Method) and EBSBM (Entropy-Based Sampling-Based Method). These methods utilize the defined uncertainty of the target concept as a statistical measure of the difference between two data blocks. Finally, extensive experiments on artificial and real-world data sets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed concept drift detection methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {This book provides a broad introduction to search engines by integrating five different perspectives on Web search and search engines that are usually dealt with separately: the technical perspective, the user perspective, the internet-based research perspective, the economic perspective, and the societal perspective. After a general introduction to the topic, two foundational chapters present how search tools can cover the Web’s content and how search engines achieve this by crawling and processing the found documents. The next chapter on user behavior covers how people phrase their search queries and interact with search engines. This knowledge builds the foundation for describing how results are ranked and presented. The following three chapters then deal with the economic side of search engines, i.e., Google and the search engine market, search engine optimization (SEO), and the intermingling of organic and sponsored search results. Next, the chapter on search skills presents techniques for improving searches through advanced search interfaces and commands. Following that, the Deep Web and how its content can be accessed is explained. The two subsequent chapters cover ways to improve the quality of search results, while the next chapter describes how to access the Deep Web. Last but not least, the following chapter deals with the societal role of search engines before the final chapter concludes the book with an outlook on the future of Web search. With this book, students and professionals in disciplines like computer science, online marketing, or library and information science will learn how search engines work, what their main shortcomings are at present, and what prospects there are for their further development. The different views presented will help them to understand not only the basic technologies but also the implications the current implementations have concerning economic exploitation and societal impact. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.}

	abstract = {In today's society, time is considered more valuable than money, and researchers often have limited time to find relevant papers for their research. Identifying and accessing essential information can be a challenge in this situation. To address this, the personalized suggestion system has been developed, which uses a user's behavior data to suggest relevant items. The collaborative filtering strategy has been used to provide a user with the top research articles based on their queries and similarities with other users' questions, thus saving time by avoiding time-consuming searches. However, when rating data is abundant but sparse, the usual method of determining user similarity is relatively straightforward. Furthermore, it fails to account for changes in users' interests over time resulting in poor performance. This research proposes a new similarity measure approach that takes both user confidence and time context into account to increase user similarity computation. The experimental results show that the proposed technique works well with sparse data, and improves accuracy by 16.2\% compared to existing models, especially during prediction. Furthermore, it enhances the quality of recommendations.},

	abstract = {To comprehend the genuine reading habits and preferences of diverse user cohorts and furnish tailored reading recommendations, this study introduces an English text reading recommendation model designed specifically for long-tail users. This model integrates collaborative filtering algorithms with the FastText classification method. Initially, the integrated collaborative filtering algorithm is explicated, followed by the calculation of the user's interest distribution across various types of English texts, achieved through an enhanced Ebbinghaus forgetting curve and analysis of user reading behaviors. Subsequently, an intelligent English text reading recommendation is generated by amalgamating collaborative filtering algorithms with association rule-based recommendation algorithms. Through optimization of the recommendation generation process, the model's recommendation accuracy is enhanced, thereby augmenting the performance and user satisfaction of the recommendation system. Finally, a comparative analysis is conducted with respect to the Top-N algorithm model, matrix factorization-based algorithm model, and FastText classification model, illustrating the superior recommendation accuracy and F-Measure value of the proposed model. The study findings indicate that when the recommendation list contains 10, 30, 50, and 70 texts, the recommendation accuracy of the proposed algorithm model is 0.75, 0.79, 0.8, and 0.74, respectively, outperforming other algorithms. Furthermore, as the number of texts increases, the F-Measure of all four models gradually improves, with the final F-Measure of the proposed model reaching 0.81. Notably, the F-Measure of the English text reading recommendation model proposed in this study significantly surpasses that of the other three recommendation methods. Demonstrating commendable performance in recall rate, root mean square error, normalized cumulative gain, precision, and accuracy, the model adeptly reflects user reading interests, thereby enhancing the accuracy of text recommendations and the overall system performance. The study findings offer crucial insights and guidance for enhancing the accuracy and overall efficacy of English text recommendation systems. © 2024 The Author},

	abstract = {Recommender systems have the effect of guiding users in a personalized way to interesting objects in a large space of possible options. Content-based recommendation systems try to recommend items similar to those a given user has liked in the past. Indeed, the basic process performed by a content-based recommender consists in matching up the attributes of a user profile in which preferences and interests are stored, with the attributes of a content object (item), in order to recommend to the user new interesting items. This chapter provides an overview of content-based recommender systems, with the aim of imposing a degree of order on the diversity of the different aspects involved in their design and implementation. The first part of the chapter presents the basic concepts and terminology of contentbased recommender systems, a high level architecture, and their main advantages and drawbacks. The second part of the chapter provides a review of the state of the art of systems adopted in several application domains, by thoroughly describing both classical and advanced techniques for representing items and user profiles. The most widely adopted techniques for learning user profiles are also presented. The last part of the chapter discusses trends and future research which might lead towards the next generation of systems, by describing the role of User Generated Content as a way for taking into account evolving vocabularies, and the challenge of feeding users with serendipitous recommendations, that is to say surprisingly interesting items that they might not have otherwise discovered.},

With the exponential increase in the number of research papers that are getting published every year, it has made scholars face the problem of information overload where they find it difficult to conduct comprehensive literature surveys. An article recommendation system helps in overcoming this issue by providing users with personalized recommendations based on their interests and choices. The common approaches used for recommendation are Content-Based Filtering (CBF) and Collaborative Filtering (CF). Even though there is much advancement in the field of article recommendation systems, a content-based approach using a deep learning technology is still in its inception. In this work, a C-SAR model using Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) and association rule mining Apriori algorithm to provide a recommendation of articles based on the similarity in the content were proposed. The combination of a deep learning technique along with a classical algorithm in data mining is expected to provide better results than the state-of-art model in suggesting similar papers. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.},

Accordingly, a big effort is now spent to investigate to what extent such information can be exploited to develop new knowledge-based services or to improve the effectiveness of knowledge-intensive platforms as Recommender Systems (RS). To this end, in this article we study the impact of the exogenous knowledge coming from the LOD cloud on the overall performance of a graph-based recommendation framework. Specifically, we propose a methodology to automatically feed a graph-based RS with features gathered from the LOD cloud and we analyze the impact of several widespread feature selection techniques in such recommendation settings. The experimental evaluation, performed on three state-of-the-art datasets, provided several outcomes: first, information extracted from the LOD cloud can significantly improve the performance of a graph-based RS. Next, experiments showed a clear correlation between the choice of the feature selection technique and the ability of the algorithm to maximize specific evaluation metrics, as accuracy or diversity of the recommendations. Moreover, our graph-based algorithm fed with LOD-based features was able to overcome several baselines, as collaborative filtering and matrix factorization. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Recommender systems improve access to relevant products and information by making personalized suggestions based on previous examples of a user's likes and dislikes. Most existing recommender systems use collaborative filtering methods that base recommendations on other user's preferences. By contrast content-based methods use information about an item itself to make suggestions. This approach has the advantage of being able to recommend previously unrated items to users with unique interests and to provide explanations for its recommendations. We describe a content-based book recommending system that utilizes information extraction and a machine-learning algorithm for text categorization. Initial experimental results demonstrate that this approach can produce accurate recommendations.},

	abstract = {Recommender Systems can greatly enhance the exploitation of large digital libraries, however, in order to achieve good accuracy with collaborative recommenders some domain assumptions must be met, such as having a large number of users sharing similar interests over time. Such assumptions may not hold in digital libraries, where users are structured in relatively small groups of experts whose interests may change in unpredictable ways: this is the case of scientific and technical documents archives. Moreover, when recommending documents, users often expect insights on the recommended content as well as a detailed explanation of why the system has selected it, which cannot be provided by collaborative techniques. In this paper we consider the domain of scientific publications repositories and propose a content-based recommender based upon a graph representation of concepts built up by linked keyphrases. This recommender is coupled with a keyphrase extraction system able to generate meaningful metadata for the documents, which are the basis for providing helpful and explainable recommendations. 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.
