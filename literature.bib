   abstract = {Semantic-enhanced recommendation systems are promising approaches to overcome the sparsity and cold-start problems, which are hard to handle using the conventional collaborative filtering (CF) approaches. Further research is needed to effectively integrate ontologies into collaborative filtering recommender systems. This paper proposes an ontology-based semantic similarity measure to evaluate similarities between items and eventually generate accurate recommendations. The proposed semantic similarity measure termed fusion-based semantic similarity takes into account the semantics of ontological instances (i.e. items) inferred from a specific domain ontology, which is determined by analyzing the hierarchical relationships among the instances, as well as the features of the instances and their relationships to other instances. The new measure comprehensively captures the semantic knowledge associated with instances by exploiting all possible shared semantics between instances in a given domain ontology. Furthermore, this paper proposes a new semantic-enhanced hybrid recommendation approach as a result of combining the new semantic similarity measure with the standard item-based CF to enhance the quality of generated recommendations. In order to assess the effectiveness of our semantic-enhanced hybrid collaborative filtering method, a series of experiments were conducted to compare the performance of the proposed approach against well-established benchmark techniques. The reported experimental results consistently emphasize its superiority, demonstrating enhanced predictive abilities and a notable improvement in the quality of recommendations. More specifically, the proposed approach achieved notable 6\% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) in certain cases, outperforming other benchmark techniques. Additionally, this study highlights the potential of using semantic-based similarity to enhance the performance of recommendation systems. Such enhancements address challenges within collaborative filtering, potentially leading to advancements in recommendation system design and optimization. © The Author(s) 2024.},

   abstract = {Improving the efficiency of methods has been a big challenge in recommender systems. It has been also important to consider the trade-off between the accuracy and the computation time in recommending the items by the recommender systems as they need to produce the recommendations accurately and meanwhile in real-time. In this regard, this research develops a new hybrid recommendation method based on Collaborative Filtering (CF) approaches. Accordingly, in this research we solve two main drawbacks of recommender systems, sparsity and scalability, using dimensionality reduction and ontology techniques. Then, we use ontology to improve the accuracy of recommendations in CF part. In the CF part, we also use a dimensionality reduction technique, Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), to find the most similar items and users in each cluster of items and users which can significantly improve the scalability of the recommendation method. We evaluate the method on two real-world datasets to show its effectiveness and compare the results with the results of methods in the literature. The results showed that our method is effective in improving the sparsity and scalability problems in CF. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {Typically, user behaviour occurs continuously, and considering this dynamic sequence correlation can lead to more accurate recommendations. Sequential recommendation systems have, therefore, become an important means of solving the problem of network information overload. However, existing attention mechanisms are still insufficient for modelling users’ dynamic and diverse preferences. This paper presents a recommendation model based on a multiheaded self-attention mechanism and multitemporal embeddings of long- and short-term interests (MSMT-LSI). MSMT-LSI balances users’ long- and short-term benefits through two multihead self-attention networks and finally forms a hybrid representation for recommendation. After finding the most suitable parameter combinations for the MSMT-LSI model through parameter sensitivity analysis and verifying the advantages of the long- and short-term fusion strategy, related experiments on five well-known datasets and their analysis shows that the performance of MSMT-LSI is better than that of the classical model on the same benchmark dataset. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Matrix factorization is a long-established method employed for analyzing and extracting valuable insight recommendations from complex networks containing user ratings. The execution time and computational resources demanded by these algorithms pose limitations when confronted with large datasets. Community detection algorithms play a crucial role in identifying groups and communities within intricate networks. To overcome the challenge of extensive computing resources with matrix factorization techniques, we present a novel framework that utilizes the inherent community information of the rating network. Our proposed approach, named Community-Based Matrix Factorization (CBMF), has the following steps: (1) Model the rating network as a complex bipartite network. (2) Divide the network into communities. (3) Extract the rating matrices pertaining only to those communities and apply MF on these matrices in parallel. (4) Merge the predicted rating matrices belonging to communities and evaluate the root mean square error (RMSE). In our experimentation, we use basic MF, SVD++, and FANMF for matrix factorization, and the Louvain algorithm is used for community division. The experimental evaluation on six datasets shows that the proposed CBMF enhances the quality of recommendations in each case. In the MovieLens 100K dataset, RMSE has been reduced to 0.21 from 1.26 using SVD++ by dividing the network into 25 communities. A similar reduction in RMSE is observed for the datasets of FilmTrust, Jester, Wikilens, Good Books, and Cell Phone. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As time passes, the data within information systems may continuously evolve, causing the target concept to drift. To ensure the effectiveness of data-driven decision making, it is crucial to detect drift in a timely manner and gather relevant information. In this paper, we introduce two methods that can directly detect concept drift in the provided information system, by considering a new perspective on uncertainty. First, using entropy under a single attribute constraint, we define the uncertainty of the target concept in an information system. By integrating the uncertainty of each attribute, the overall uncertainty of the target concept in the information system is obtained. Subsequently, two concept drift detection methods are proposed, namely EBTBM (Entropy-Based Threshold-Based Method) and EBSBM (Entropy-Based Sampling-Based Method). These methods utilize the defined uncertainty of the target concept as a statistical measure of the difference between two data blocks. Finally, extensive experiments on artificial and real-world data sets are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed concept drift detection methods. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Data collected over time often exhibit changes in distribution, or concept drift, caused by changes in factors relevant to the classification task, e.g. weather conditions. Incorporating all relevant factors into the model may be able to capture these changes, however, this is usually not practical. Data stream based methods, which instead explicitly detect concept drift, have been shown to retain performance under unknown changing conditions. These methods adapt to concept drift by training a model to classify each distinct data distribution. However, we hypothesize that existing methods do not robustly handle real-world tasks, leading to adaptation errors where context is misidentified. Adaptation errors may cause a system to use a model which does not fit the current data, reducing performance. We propose a novel repair algorithm to identify and correct errors in concept drift adaptation. Evaluation on synthetic data shows that our proposed AiRStream system has higher performance than baseline methods, while is also better at capturing the dynamics of the stream. Evaluation on an air quality inference task shows AiRStream provides increased real-world performance compared to eight baseline methods. A case study shows that AiRStream is able to build a robust model of environmental conditions over this task, allowing the adaptions made to concept drift to be analysed and related to changes in weather. We discovered a strong predictive link between the adaptions made by AiRStream and changes in meteorological conditions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {This book provides a broad introduction to search engines by integrating five different perspectives on Web search and search engines that are usually dealt with separately: the technical perspective, the user perspective, the internet-based research perspective, the economic perspective, and the societal perspective. After a general introduction to the topic, two foundational chapters present how search tools can cover the Web’s content and how search engines achieve this by crawling and processing the found documents. The next chapter on user behavior covers how people phrase their search queries and interact with search engines. This knowledge builds the foundation for describing how results are ranked and presented. The following three chapters then deal with the economic side of search engines, i.e., Google and the search engine market, search engine optimization (SEO), and the intermingling of organic and sponsored search results. Next, the chapter on search skills presents techniques for improving searches through advanced search interfaces and commands. Following that, the Deep Web and how its content can be accessed is explained. The two subsequent chapters cover ways to improve the quality of search results, while the next chapter describes how to access the Deep Web. Last but not least, the following chapter deals with the societal role of search engines before the final chapter concludes the book with an outlook on the future of Web search. With this book, students and professionals in disciplines like computer science, online marketing, or library and information science will learn how search engines work, what their main shortcomings are at present, and what prospects there are for their further development. The different views presented will help them to understand not only the basic technologies but also the implications the current implementations have concerning economic exploitation and societal impact. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.}
